Game Maker Tool Kit Game Jam 2022

Rules and Recomendations:
Just note that many players will be alone (so they may not be able to adequately judge local multiplayer games) and will only have a few minutes to try your game (so get to the point quickly!)

You can not require the user to have hardware beyond a keyboard and mouse (so no VR games, webcam games, and no controller-only games)

Your game must not contain nudity, or hateful language or visuals. This could see your game being disqualified. Please consider avoiding extremely strong language and excessive gore, as the jam should be suitable for a general audience. If youâ€™re uncertain, err on the side of being less gratuitous.

Upon submission, you will be asked whether your team created the vast majority of the game's art during the jam. (This does include animations, but not shaders or fonts). And you will be asked if you made the vast majority of the game's music, during the 48 hour period. (This doesn't include sound effects).

This is a way of highlighting the artists and composers who were involved with the jam, and this will not impact your rating.
